                <h1>What was happening in the war</h1> 
                <p>The French had constructed several forts in this region to strengthen their claim on the territory. British colonial forces, led by Lieutenant Colonel George Washington, tried to expel the French in 1754, but were outnumbered and defeated by the French.</p>

After these negotiations failed, Spanish King Charles III offered to come to the aid of his cousin
