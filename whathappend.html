                <h1>What happened after the war</h1> 
                <p>British territorial holdings now extended from Canada to Florida, and British military focus shifted to keeping peace in the king’s newly enlarged lands. However, much of the land in the American British Empire remained under the control of powerful native confederacies, which made any claims of British mastery beyond the Atlantic coastal settlements hollow. Great Britain kept ten thousand troops in North America after the war ended in 1763 to defend the borders and repel any attack by their imperial rivals.</p>

However, after 1757 the war began to turn in favor of Great Britain. British forces defeated French forces in India, and in 1759 British armies invaded and conquered Canada.</p> 
                <p> Facing defeat in North America and a tenuous position in Europe, the French Government tried to engage the British in peace negotiations, but British Minister William Pitt (the elder), Secretary for Southern Affairs, looked for not only the French cession of Canada but also commercial concessions that the French Government found unacceptable. After these negotiations failed, Spanish King Charles III offered to come to the aid of his cousin</p>
